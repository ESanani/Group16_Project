#### Group16_Project ####
The purpose of the application is to track and manage a persons tasks or schedules in an effort to increase their productivity.
* Working Functions
  - The application provides a two month overview of how much they've accomplished, what's still in progress, and what's new.  
  - Users can create a new planner by entering the planner name, descrption or task name, date, and the status. 
  - Users can quickly view and edit their planners in one place. 
* Not Working Functions
  - Users won't be able to save data since the preferred method would be to store the data in a data base or serialization.
  - Because of the above reason, the overview functionality is demonstrated by using test data which has been provided.
  - Users won't be able to change the profile picture or name for the above reasons as well. 
* Running the application
  - No additional setup is required to run the application. Just press run. 
  - Test data is stored in a .csv file.
  - All icons used in the application have been provided as well.
